<h1>Benefits of online trading:</h1>
<body>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know we now trade securities such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, options, futures and currencies almost entirely online. It’s easy, and efficient. But that’s a high level perspective. In this post, we’ll zoom in the lens on online trading to bring you a clear picture about how it works, its benefits and how to trade online. After you learn about the basics and benefits of trading online, you can do it hassle-free through your brokerage's internet-based proprietary trading platform.

<br>Key Points:
Before the era of online trading, traders had to call and give ‘buy’ and ‘sell’ order to their brokerage firms to trade for them.
With the advent of the internet in this digital era, the vast majority of traders have moved to online trading platforms.
One of the most important advantages of online trading is that it gives you greater control over your investments.</br></body>
